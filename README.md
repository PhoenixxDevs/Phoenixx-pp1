##Initial Discussion

Phoenixx Music is an artist website that is created to be a showcase of the artist's work and to provide information on who the artist is, upcoming shows and how to get in touch.

After recording his first EP and performing at multiple events, the artist needs a place to direct fans and promoters which will serve as a hub to direct visitors to what they are searching for.
