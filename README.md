## Initial Discussion

After recording his first EP and performing at multiple events, the artist needs a place to direct fans and promoters which will serve as a hub to direct visitors to what they are searching for.
## Important Information to Include
- Links to streaming platforms
- Links to social media
- Tour dates and events
- Where to buy tickets
- A gallery devoted to the artist's highlights
